# E-mail Merge Program

We noticed that some people's e-mail addresses receive too many pdf e-mails for invoice receipts. In particular, people who sell online or shoppers, private institutions, etc. And in this case, all these incoming pdfs can take a lot of time for a person to download and some pdfs can be missed. So we designed such a program and.

In this program, we have prepared software where the user can adjust the messages received from certain people and within a certain period of time. Users who receive too many pdf files will be able to set specific criteria in this way, and the pdfs they want are quickly downloaded, combined, and presented to the user.
