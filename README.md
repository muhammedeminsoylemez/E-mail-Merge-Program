# E-mail Merge Program

We noticed that some people receive too many pdf e-mails for invoice receipts. In particular, people who sell online or shoppers, private institutions, etc. And in this case, downloading all these incoming pdfs can take a lot of time and some pdfs can be missed.

This program is prepared to help users for adjusting the criterias such as messages received from certain people and within a certain period of time and downloading pdf files which are proper for selected criterias. Users who receive too many pdf files will be able to set specific criteria in this way, and the pdfs they want are quickly downloaded, combined, and presented to the user.
